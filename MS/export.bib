	abstract = {<p>The discipline of plant pathology has an expanding remit requiring a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary approach to capture the complexity of interactions for any given disease, disease complex or syndrome. This review discussed recent developments in plant pathology research and identifies some key issues that, we anticipate, must be faced to meet the food security and environmental challenges that will arise over coming decades. In meeting these issues, the challenge in turn is for the plant pathology community to respond by contributing to a wider forum for multidisciplinary research, recognising that impact will depend not just on advances in the plant pathology discipline alone, but on interactions more broadly with other agricultural and ecological sciences, and with the needs of national and global policies and regulation. A challenge more readily met once plant pathologists again gather physically at international meetings and return to the professional and social encounters that are fertile grounds for developing new ideas and forging collaborative approaches both within plant pathology and with other disciplines. In this review we emphasise, in particular: the multidisciplinary links between plant pathology and other disciplines; disease management, including precision agriculture, plant growth and development, and decision analysis and disease risk; the development and use of new and novel plant protection chemicals; new ways of exploiting host genetic diversity including host resistance deployment; a new perspective on biological control and microbial interactions; advances in surveillance and detection technologies; invasion of exotic and re-emerging plant pathogens; and the consequences of climate change affecting all aspects of agriculture, the environment, and their interactions. We draw conclusions in each of these areas, but in reaching forward over the next few decades, these inevitably lead to further research questions rather than solutions to the challenges we anticipate.</p>},

Isolation in axenic culture was attempted and assays were carried out for determining its pathogenicity to olive, oleander and myrtle-leaf milkwort. The bacterium was readily detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in all diseased olive trees sampled in different and geographically separated infection foci, and culturing of 51 isolates, each from a distinct OQDS focus, was accomplished. Needle-inoculation experiments under different environmental conditions proved that the Salentinian isolate De Donno belonging to the subspecies <italic>pauca</italic> is able to multiply and systemically invade artificially inoculated hosts, reproducing symptoms observed in the field.

	abstract = {Among plant viruses, Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) is considered as the most widespread and to have the largest host-range. This virus is responsible for numerous epidemics in different regions of the world, mainly in horticultural and floral crops, which are often destructive and cause heavy economic losses. The highly polyphagous nature, the efficiency of virus transmission and the biological activity of its vectors, the rapidity with which new variants arise, and difficulties in the control of the vectors, make TSWV one of the most feared plant viruses by growers of agricultural crops. Preventive and integrated cultural practices such as the eradication of weed hosts able to serve as virus reservoirs, combined with vector management strategies, play a crucial role in the control of the virus. Thus, the availability of an up-to-date list of TSWV host plants is a potentially useful reference for researchers and farmers. The current list of TSWV hosts consists of 1090 plants species belonging in 15 families of monocotyledonous plants, 69 families of dicotyledonous plants and one family of pteridophytes.},

However, to be used in decision-making, they must be carefully parametrized and validated with epidemiological data as well as biological information on the relevant players. Here, benefitting of the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, which has occurred in Southern Italy since 2013, an epidemiological model describing this epidemic is presented. Beside the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, the OQDS main players considered in the model are its insect vectors, Philaenus spumarius, and the host plants (olive trees and weeds) of the insects and of the bacterium. The model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations, the analysis of which have provided interesting results about possible equilibria of the epidemic system and guidelines for its numerical simulations. These, under a variety of parameter scenarios, have led to the model sensitivity analysis, hence to understanding the parameters relative importance in the transmission of the disease. Although the model presented here is mathematically rather simplified, its analysis has highlighted threshold parameters that could be the target of control strategies within the integrated pest management framework, not requiring the removal of the productive resource represented by the olive trees. Indeed numerical simulations support the outcomes of the mathematical analysis according to which a removal of a suitable amount of weeds biomass (reservoir of Xylella fastidiosa) from olive orchards and surrounding areas resulted the most efficient strategy to control the spread of the OQDS. In addition, as expected, the adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good strategy, though less cost-effective, in controlling the pathogen.}

	abstract={In a recent paper by one of the authors and collaborators, motivated by the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, which has been ongoing in Southern Italy since 2013, a simple epidemiological model describing this epidemic was presented. Beside the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, the main players considered in the model are its insect vectors, Philaenus spumarius, and the host plants (olive trees and weeds) of the insects and of the bacterium. The model was based on a system of ordinary differential equations, the analysis of which provided interesting results about possible equilibria of the epidemic system and guidelines for its numerical simulations.

In addition, as expected, the adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good strategy, though less cost-effective, in controlling the pathogen. In this paper for a more realistic description and a clearer interpretation of the proposed control measures, a spatial structure of the epidemic system has been included, but, in order to keep mathematical technicalities to a minimum, only two players have been described in a dynamical way, trees and insects, while the weed biomass is taken to be a given quantity. The control measures have been introduced only on a subregion of the whole habitat, in order to contain costs of intervention. We show that such a practice can lead to the eradication of an epidemic outbreak. Numerical simulations confirm both the results of the previous paper and the theoretical results of the model with a spatial structure, though subject to regional control only},

	abstract = { Outbreak response to quarantine pathogens and pests in the European Union (EU) is regulated by the EU Plant Health Law, but the performance of outbreak management plans in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency has been quantified only to a limited extent. As a case study, the disease dynamics of almond leaf scorch, caused by Xylella fastidiosa, in the affected area of Alicante, Spain, were approximated using an individual-based spatial epidemiological model. The emergence of this outbreak was dated based on phylogenetic studies, and official surveys were used to delimit the current extent of the disease. Different survey strategies and disease control measures were compared to determine their effectiveness and efficiency for outbreak management in relation to a baseline scenario without interventions. One-step and two-step survey approaches were compared with different confidence levels, buffer zone sizes, and eradication radii, including those set by the EU legislation for X. fastidiosa. The effect of disease control interventions was also considered by decreasing the transmission rate in the buffer zone. All outbreak management plans reduced the number of infected trees (effectiveness), but large differences were observed in the number of susceptible trees not eradicated (efficiency). The two-step survey approach, high confidence level, and the reduction in the transmission rate increased the efficiency. Only the outbreak management plans with the two-step survey approach removed infected trees completely, but they required greater survey efforts. Although control measures reduced disease spread, surveillance was the key factor in the effectiveness and efficiency of the outbreak management plans. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {For infectious disease dynamical models to inform policy for containment of infectious diseases the models must be able to predict; however, it is well recognised that such prediction will never be perfect. Nevertheless, the consensus is that although models are uncertain, some may yet inform effective action. This assumes that the quality of a model can be ascertained in order to evaluate sufficiently model uncertainties, and to decide whether or not, or in what ways or under what conditions, the model should be ‘used’. We examined uncertainty in modelling, utilising a range of data: interviews with scientists, policy-makers and advisors, and analysis of policy documents, scientific publications and reports of major inquiries into key livestock epidemics. We show that the discourse of uncertainty in infectious disease models is multi-layered, flexible, contingent, embedded in context and plays a critical role in negotiating model credibility. We argue that usability and stability of a model is an outcome of the negotiation that occurs within the networks and discourses surrounding it. This negotiation employs a range of discursive devices that renders uncertainty in infectious disease modelling a plastic quality that is amenable to ‘interpretive flexibility’. The utility of models in the face of uncertainty is a function of this flexibility, the negotiation this allows, and the contexts in which model outputs are framed and interpreted in the decision making process. We contend that rather than being based predominantly on beliefs about quality, the usefulness and authority of a model may at times be primarily based on its functional status within the broad social and political environment in which it acts.},

While the phenology and ecology of P. spumarius can help determine its contributions to PD epidemics, both remain poorly described in the North Coast vineyards of California. We assessed the phenology of P. spumarius in the region. Spittlemasses were first observed in February or March, while the emergence of adult spittlebugs did not occur until April or May depending on the year. Analysis of sweep and trap data from 2016 to 2018 revealed significant effects of survey month, vineyard site, and year on adult abundance in sweep and trap surveys. Spittlebug adults were present in the vineyards from April until December, with the greatest number of adults by sweep net in May or June, whereas adults on traps peaked between July and November. Analysis of natural infectivity in groups of field-collected spittlebug adults showed significant difference in transmission rates among months. Spittlebugs successfully transmitted Xylella fastidiosa (Wells) (Xanthomonadales: Xanthomonadaceae) to potted grapevines between July and December. The greatest risk of X. fastidiosa transmission by P. spumarius was in December (60\%) followed by October (30\%). However, the infectivity patterns of the meadow spittlebug did not align with the historical paradigm of California North Coast PD. We discuss alternative hypotheses in which P. spumarius could play a role in the epidemiology of this disease.},

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the disease outside of the San Francisco to Monterey area in California, (300 km to the south). Nine areas of infestation, all within a 24-km2 area, were discovered on forest lands near Brookings, in southwest Oregon. Mortality centers ranged in size from 0.2 to 4.5 ha and included 5 to approximately 40 diseased trees. P. ramorum was isolated from stem cankers using Phytophthora-selective medium. Isolates had distinctive morphological features characteristic of P. ramorum, including abundant production of chlamydospores and caducous, semipapillate sporangia on solid media. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of isolates of P. ramorum from Oregon were identical to ITS sequences of isolates from California (1). The pathogen also was isolated from necrotic lesions on leaves and stems of native Rhododendron macrophyllum and Vaccinium ovatum growing beneath diseased tanoaks. In July 2001, the disease was located by an aerial survey conducted cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service and Oregon Department of Forestry. All lands within 1.6 km (1 mile) of the mortality centers are subject to Oregon quarantine, which bars the transport of any host plant materials. An eradication effort is currently underway. Symptomatic plants and all known host plants within 15 to 30 m of symptomatic plants are being cut and burned in the first phase of this operation. The total treated area is approximately 16 ha.

abstract = {Asiatic citrus canker (ACC), caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri, has been controlled by exclusion and eradication measures in São Paulo state (SP), Brazil, since it was first detected in 1957. Several protocols of eradication have been used since then, but the protocol applied from 1999 to 2009 was the most successful and well documented of these. During that time, if the incidence of trees with symptoms in a citrus block was ≤0.5\%, the infected trees and the symptomless trees within a 30 m radius were removed. However, if the incidence was >0.5\%, the entire block was eliminated. Subsequently, inspections were carried out to monitor the affected blocks during quarantine. Although this protocol did not eliminate the disease from SP, it suppressed the incidence of affected blocks to very low annual levels (<0.20\%) for a decade. Of over 5000 foci detected, 65.1\% were eliminated by removing the block, either when disease was first detected (47.8\%) or at a subsequent detection (17.3\%), and 28.4\% were eradicated by removing trees within a 30 m radius. The latter method was not an effective stand-alone measure for ACC eradication and the 0.5\% threshold was the key factor in suppression of disease statewide. Currently, a re-emergence of ACC is occurring in SP. The information presented here will aid the establishment of protocols for the eradication of ACC in other citrus-growing areas with low incidence of the disease or at risk of pathogen introduction.},

The initial infested area included nine scattered sites below 400 m elevation, close to the Pacific Ocean near Brookings, Oregon. In subsequent years, one-half of new infections were within 122 m of a previous infection, and 79\% of the newly detected trees occurred within 300 m of a previously identified tree. Dispersal up to 4 km was occasionally recorded. Initial infection occurred in the upper crowns of tanoak trees. The pathogen was recovered in rainwater collected beneath diseased tanoak trees in every month from November 2006 through October 2007. Twenty-four multilocus microsatellite genotypes were identified among 272 P. ramorum isolates collected from Curry County. Genotypic analysis provided independent estimates of time of origin of the Oregon infestation, its clustered distribution, and dispersal distances. In all sampling years, 60\%–71\% of the isolates belonged to the same multilocus genotype. In 2001, 12 genotypes were detected and new genotypes were identified in each of the subsequent years, but all isolates belonged to the same clonal lineage. Knowledge of local intensification of the disease and long-distance dispersal should inform both Oregon eradication efforts and national quarantine regulations. }

    abstract = {During 2001 to 2003, the transmission biology of Phytophthora ramorum, the causal agent of sudden oak death, was studied in mixedevergreen forest, a common forest type in northern, coastal California. Investigation of the sources of spore production focused on coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), dominant hosts that comprised 39.7 and 46.2\% of the individuals at the study site, respectively. All tests for inoculum production from the surface of infected coast live oak bark or exudates from cankers were negative. In contrast, sporangia and chlamydospores were produced on the surface of infected bay laurel leaves. Mean number of zoospores produced from infected bay laurel leaves under natural field conditions during rainstorms was 1,173.0 ± SE 301.48, and ranged as high as 5,200 spores/leaf. P. ramorum was recovered from rainwater, soil, litter, and streamwater during the mid- to late rainy season in all 3 years of the study. P. ramorum was not recovered from sporadic summer rains or soil and litter during the hot, dry summer months. Concentrations of inoculum in rainwater varied significantly from year to year and increased as the rainy season progressed for the two complete seasons that were studied. Potential dispersal distances were investigated for rainwater, soil, and streamwater. In rainwater, inoculum moved 5 and 10 m from the inoculum source. For soil, transmission of inoculum was demonstrated from infested soil to bay laurel green leaf litter, and from bay laurel green leaf litter to aerial leaves of bay laurel seedlings. One-third to one-half of the hikers tested at the study site during the rainy season also were carrying infested soil on their shoes. In streamwater, P. ramorum was recovered from an unforested site in pasture ≈ 1 km downstream of forest with inoculum sources. In total, these studies provide details on the production and spread of P. ramorum inoculum in mixed-evergreen forest to aid forecasting and managing disease transmission of this environmentally destructive pathogen. }

abstract = {Abstract Phytophthora ramorum, cause of sudden oak death, has been distributed widely across the United States in horticultural situations, but is not established in forests outside of California and Oregon. Here, it has triggered widespread concern and, especially in Oregon, an intensive disease management programme. Now, we provide the first systematic evaluation of the efficacy of that effort. This paper evaluates four measures of the efficacy of Sudden Oak Death (SOD) local eradication treatments: inoculum availability; inoculum from tree species other than tanoak; disease spread from treated areas; and cumulative infested area with and without treatment. We conclude that local treatments demonstrably reduce local inoculum levels. Eradication of SOD from infested sites is difficult but not impossible. The disease usually does not persist after cutting infected trees but spread on the landscape continues because the pathogen may be present on undetected new infections for a year or two before whole tree symptoms are visible. This limits early detection and coupled with delays in completing eradication treatments, prolongs the chances for long-distance aerial dispersal.},

Although the epidemic was managed since its first discovery in 2001, at least three invasions of three separate variants (clonal lineages), NA1, EU1, and NA2, are documented to have occurred to date. Control of this epidemic has cost over US\$32 million from 2001 to 2020. This is dwarfed by the predicted cost of the closure to the Coos Bay export terminal, estimated at \$58 million per year, if the epidemic was allowed to spread unchecked. Management efforts in Oregon have reduced inoculum and limited the spread of the pathogen. An outreach and citizen scientist program has been piloted to help in early detection efforts and search for disease-resistant tanoak. This feature article documents the repeated emergence, impact, costs, and lessons learned from managing this devastating invasive pathogen. }

   abstract = {<p>While the spread of plant disease depends strongly on biological factors driving transmission, it also has a human dimension. Disease control depends on decisions made by individual growers, who are in turn influenced by a broad range of factors. Despite this, human behaviour has rarely been included in plant epidemic models. Considering Cassava Brown Streak Disease, we model how the perceived increase in profit due to disease management influences participation in clean seed systems (CSS). Our models are rooted in game theory, with growers making strategic decisions based on the expected profitability of different control strategies. We find that both the information used by growers to assess profitability and the perception of economic and epidemiological parameters influence long-term participation in the CSS. Over-estimation of infection risk leads to lower participation in the CSS, as growers perceive that paying for the CSS will be futile. Additionally, even though good disease management can be achieved through the implementation of CSS, and a scenario where all controllers use the CSS is achievable when growers base their decision on the average of their entire strategy, CBSD is rarely eliminated from the system. These results are robust to stochastic and spatial effects. Our work highlights the importance of including human behaviour in plant disease models, but also the significance of how that behaviour is included.</p>},

In this paper we use a spatially explicit stochastic model to simulate an invading pathogen and show that it is possible to identify an optimal control radius, i.e., one that minimizes the total number of hosts removed during an eradication campaign that is effective in eradicating the pathogen. However, by simulating the epidemic and eradication processes in multiple landscapes, we demonstrate that the optimal radius depends critically on landscape pattern (i.e., the spatial configuration of hosts within the landscape). In particular, we find that the optimal radius, and also the number of host removals associated with it, increases with both the level of aggregation and the density of hosts in the landscape. The result is of practical significance and demonstrates that the location of an invading epidemic should be a key consideration in the design of future eradication strategies.</p>},

The key vector of X. fastidiosa in Europe is the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius L. The dispersal capabilities of P. spumarius are poorly known, despite being a key parameter for the prediction of the spread of the bacterium. In this study, we have examined the dispersal of P. spumarius adults in two different agroecosystems in Italy: an olive grove in Apulia (Southern Italy) and a meadow in Piedmont (Northern Italy). Insects were marked with albumin and released during seven independent trials over 2 yr. The recapture data were pooled separately for each agroecosystem and used to estimate the dispersal kernels of P. spumarius in the olive grove and in the meadow. The diffusion coefficient estimate for P. spumarius was higher in the meadow than in the olive grove. The median distance from the release point for 1 d of dispersal was 26 m in the olive grove and 35 m in the meadow. On the basis of our model, we estimated that 50\% of the spittlebug population remained within 200 m (98\% within 400 m) during the 2 mo period of high abundance of the vector on olives in Apulia. The dispersal of P. spumarius is thus limited to some hundreds of meters throughout the whole year, although it can be influenced to a great extent by the structure of the agroecosystem.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Bacterial tree diseases have been mainly studied in agriculture and horticulture. For forest trees, damage due to bacterial diseases is understudied. Moreover, bacterial tree diseases often appear in the context of socalled complex diseases, which are dependent on other factors, such as multiple microorganisms, insects or abiotic factors which weaken the host. In recent years, outbreaks of bacterial tree diseases, such as <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> in the Mediterranean region or acute oak decline (AOD) in the United Kingdom, raised the awareness of bacterial diseases on forest trees. In this review, we aim to summarise the current issues and available knowledge about bacterial diseases of forest trees in Central Europe. Furthermore, we identify potential bacterial pathogens that could gain importance in the future for central European forests. The methods used were a systematic literature search and the analysis of the data collected over the last 10 years on bacterial diseases by the Swiss forest protection service. We conclude that, on one side, complex bacterial diseases could increase in importance, especially considering ongoing climate change. Therefore, the bacterial community of diseased trees (the pathobiome) needs to be studied more in depth to understand the emergence of complex bacterial diseases. On the other side, host ranges of highly pathogenic invasive genera and species, such as <italic>Xylella,</italic> need to be investigated experimentally for common central European tree species and varieties, to implement proactive risk management strategies against bacterial diseases in forest trees. Finally, urban trees and green spaces should be monitored more closely, as they could serve as starting points for bacterial disease outbreaks in forests, similarly to other emerging diseases and pathogens. </p>},

    abstract = {Infectious diseases of plants present an ongoing and increasing threat to international biosecurity, with wide-ranging implications. An important challenge in plant disease management is achieving early detection of invading pathogens, which requires effective surveillance through the implementation of appropriate monitoring programmes. However, when monitoring relies on visual inspection as a means of detection, surveillance is often hindered by a long incubation period (delay from infection to symptom onset) during which plants may be infectious but not displaying visible symptoms. ‘Sentinel’ plants–alternative susceptible host species that display visible symptoms of infection more rapidly–could be introduced to at-risk populations and included in monitoring programmes to act as early warning beacons for infection. However, while sentinel hosts exhibit faster disease progression and so allow pathogens to be detected earlier, this often comes at a cost: faster disease progression typically promotes earlier onward transmission. Here, we construct a computational model of pathogen transmission to explore this trade-off and investigate how including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes could facilitate earlier detection of invasive plant pathogens. Using Xylella fastidiosa infection in Olea europaea (European olive) as a current high profile case study, for which Catharanthus roseus (Madagascan periwinkle) is a candidate sentinel host, we apply a Bayesian optimisation algorithm to determine the optimal number of sentinel hosts to introduce for a given sampling effort, as well as the optimal division of limited surveillance resources between crop and sentinel plants. Our results demonstrate that including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes can reduce the expected prevalence of infection upon outbreak detection substantially, increasing the feasibility of local outbreak containment.},

   abstract = {<p> Five areas in urban Miami were identified to study the spread of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri to determine if the practice of removing exposed citrus trees within 38.1 m of trees affected by citrus canker was adequate to curtail further bacterial spread. To accomplish this, 18,769 trees in dooryards were surveyed, geo-referenced by differential global positioning systems (GPS), and assayed for disease severity, age of infection, citrus cultivar, location of infection in tree, and canopy size. For each tree, the date the tree became infected was estimated and used to separate trees into contiguous 30-day categories. For each area studied, distance measurements between focal trees and newly infected trees were calculated for various temporal periods of 30, 60, 90, and 120 days in duration, corresponding to intervals of inspection survey. A visual basic application was used to calculate the distances between each newly diseased tree and all prior focal trees. The nearest distance was used because it was considered the most conservative estimate possible. It is therefore likely to be an underestimate of spread but is a good estimate of the minimum possible distances of spread. For the first four 30-day periods among the five study areas, calculated maximum distances of spread ranged from 12 to 3,474 m, indicating a broad continuum of distance for bacterial spread was possible. Disease increased during the first two-thirds of the time studied and reached an asymptote due to dry conditions in the final one-third of the duration of the study. Cross correlation analysis indicated that disease was best visualized 107 days following rainstorms with wind. Analysis of regional spatial point patterns was performed temporally for each 30-day period via a modified Ripley's K-function. Spatiotemporal analyses between periods over areas larger than previously examined were accomplished via spatiotemporal semivariogram analysis. These methods in combination demonstrated rapid increases in range of spatial dependency and range of spatiotemporal dependency for all study sites. This corresponded to rapid spread of disease across the regions studied in response to rainstorms with wind followed by a “filling in” of disease on remaining noninfected susceptible trees through time by less intense rain events. A stochastic quadratization technique demonstrated that disease incidence and disease severity were not greatly affected by urban host density but were positively correlated to host susceptibility within local 0.25-km <sup>2</sup> quadrats. </p>},

Detailed spatial information on the distribution and condition of crops at regional and national scales is essential to ensure the continuity of crop quality and yield efficiency.

Therefore, we evaluated the performance of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion for the regional mapping of olive trees for the first time, using the Izmir Province of Türkiye, an ancient olive-growing region, as a case study. Three different monthly composite images reflecting the different phenological stages of olive trees were selected to separate olive trees from other land cover types. Seven land-cover classes, including olives, were mapped separately using a random forest classifier for each year between 2017 and 2021. The results were assessed using the k-fold cross-validation method, and the final olive tree map of Izmir was produced by combining the olive tree distribution over two consecutive years. District-level areas covered by olive trees were calculated and validated using official statistics from the Turkish Statistical Instit.},

Taking into account that this is the first confirmed record of the presence of Xf in the European Union (EU) territory and fairing its possible spread from the affected site, the EU has issued the Commission Implementing Decision L 45/29-31 (February 24, 2014), which prohibits the transfer from the province of Lecce of all plant genera and species not listed in the Annex I of the cited Decision. A survey was therefore initiated to verify the health status of a number of ornamental and forestry plants growing mostly in nurseries, but also in public and private gardens, which are or can be naturally exposed to high inoculum pressure. Samples collected from 207 conifers, 105 members of the family Arecaceae, Musaceae and Cycadaceae, and 208 succulent plants (totalling 520) were comparatively examined by serological (DAS-ELISA) and molecular (PCR) methods. None of the tested plant species proved to be infected, providing a strong indication that they may not be susceptible to field infection by the Xf subsp. pauca strain currently present in the province of Lecce.},

Xfm IVIA5901 (isolated from almonds in Alicante, Spain) caused symptoms similar to those caused by Xfm AlmaEm3 (isolated from blueberries in Georgia, U.S.A., and used as a reference strain capable of inducing severe symptoms in blueberry). Nevertheless, bacterial populations of Xfm IVIA5901 in planta were significantly lower than those of Xfm AlmaEm3.

This study suggests that certain strains already found in Europe could infect blueberry if conditions conducive for a host jump in this region are met, such as proximity of blueberries to other infected hosts and presence of insect vectors that feed on these crops.

The soil scarification methods ranged from full surface ploughing by tractor or horse through small-scale scarification by cultivators to sites without soil scarification. Differences in the densities, spatial distributions, age structures, and above-ground development of pine seedlings were evaluated. We analysed the spatial interactions between overstorey pine trees and the densities of naturally regenerated pine seedlings as a function of the microsite types using the multitype Strauss hard-core process (MSH) method. The results show a significant decrease in height growth with increasing stand density after a period of 5 years, with seedling density and spatial patterns strongly influenced by soil scarification.

Mathematical modellingModelling is a key tool in predicting where and how these new threats will spread, as well as in assessing how damaging they might be. Models can also be used to inform disease management, providing a rational methodology for comparing the performance of possible control strategies against one another. For emerging epidemics, in which new pathogens or pathogen strains are actively spreading into new regions, the spatial component of spread becomes particularly important, both to make predictions and to optimise disease control. In this chapter we illustrate how the spatial spread of emerging plant diseases can be modelled at the landscape scale via spatially explicit compartmental modelsModellingspatially explicit compartmental models. Our particular focus is on the crucial role of the dispersal kernel – which parameterises the probability of pathogen spread from an infected host to susceptible hosts at any given distance – in determining outcomes of epidemics. We add disease management to our model by testing performance of a simple ``one off'' form of reactive disease control, in which sites within a particular distance of locations detected to contain infection are removed in a single round of disease management. We use this simplified model to show how ostensibly arcane decisions made by the modeller – most notably whether or not the underpinning disease model allows for stochasticity (i.e. randomness) – can greatly impact on disease management recommendations. Our chapter is accompanied (see Supplementary Material) by example code in the programming language R available via an online repository, allowing readers to run the models we present for themselves.},

After treatments, stylet probing behaviors were recorded on healthy grapevine via AC-DC electropenetrography. Waveforms representing putative Xf inoculation (XB1 [salivation and rinsing egestion] and XC1 [discharging egestion]) and other behaviors were statistically compared among treatments. Mean number of events per insect and 'total' duration per insect of XB1 and XC1 were highest for insects from healthy grape, lowest for basil (regardless of insect age), and intermediate for Xf-infected grape. The surprising results showed that prior exposure to healthy grapevines had a stronger effect on subsequent performance of inoculation behaviors on healthy grapevine than did prior exposure to Xf-infected grapevine. It is hypothesized that non-Xf microbes were acquired from healthy grapevine, causing greater clogging of the precibarium, leading to more performance of inoculation behaviors. This study shows for the first time that presence of noncirculative, foregut-borne microbes can directly manipulate a vector's behavior to increase inoculation. Also, EPG can uniquely visualize the dynamic interactions between vectors and the microbes they carry.},

Their spatial structure, which resembles that of a regular lattice, makes such networks fairly robust against epidemics. Yet, it is well-known how the addition of a few shortcuts can turn robust regular lattices into vulnerable ‘small world’ networks. Although the relevance of this phenomenon has been shown theoretically for networks with nodes corresponding to individual host plants, its real-world implications at a larger scale (i.e. in networks with nodes representing crop fields or other plantations) remain elusive. Focusing on realistic spatial networks connecting olive orchards in Andalusia (Southern Spain), the world's leading olive producer, we show how even very small probabilities of long distance dispersal of infectious vectors result in a small-world effect that dramatically exacerbates a hypothetical outbreak of a disease targeting olive trees (loosely modelled on known epidemiological information on the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, an important emerging threat for European agriculture). More specifically, we found that the probability of long distance vector dispersal has a disproportionately larger effect on epidemic dynamics compared to pathogen's intrinsic infectivity, increasing total infected area by up to one order of magnitude (in the absence of quarantine). Furthermore, even a very small probability of long distance dispersal increased the effort needed to halt a hypothetical outbreak through quarantine by about.},

The basic reproduction number, a central quantity in the study of epidemic dynamics, is affected by host clustering as well as host density. Several authors have developed methods to quantify the basic reproduction number in a spatially structured host population. The methods used and the expressions derived are however difficult to apply to real life spatial host structures. In this paper we introduce an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number using the O-ring statistic, developed in spatial statistics, that quantifies the host density as a function of the distance from a randomly selected host individual. The O-ring statistic is frequently used in the study of the ecology of spatially structured plant populations, being a convenient summary of the properties of a landscape by way of a single function. The connection we develop between spatial statistics and epidemic dynamics can be used to study the effect of host spatial pattern on the basic reproduction number of infectious diseases. As well as showing how explicit expressions for the basic reproduction number can be derived for landscapes with standard structures, our expression for the basic reproduction number is tested against a simulation model. The model structure in our simulation is motivated by the spread of a plant disease epidemic, although it is applicable more broadly. The agreement between our analytic expression for the basic reproduction number and the corresponding numeric quantity extracted from simulations is close to perfect across a wide range of landscape structures and model parameterisations, and including cases in which more than one species of host is at risk of infection.},

In the past decade, reports of X. fastidiosa across the globe have dramatically increased its known occurrence. This raises important questions: How does X. fastidiosa interact with the different host plants? How does the bacterium interact with the plant immune system? How does it influence the host’s microbiome?

   abstract = {Knowledge of the incubation period of infectious diseases (time between host infection and expression of disease symptoms) is crucial to our epidemiological understanding and the design of appropriate prevention and control policies. Plant diseases cause substantial damage to agricultural and arboricultural systems, but there is still very little information about how the incubation period varies within host populations. In this paper, we focus on the incubation period of soilborne plant pathogens, which are difficult to detect as they spread and infect the hosts underground and above-ground symptoms occur considerably later. We conducted experiments on Rhizoctonia solani in sugar beet, as an example pathosystem, and used modelling approaches to estimate the incubation period distribution and demonstrate the impact of differing estimations on our epidemiological understanding of plant diseases. We present measurements of the incubation period obtained in field conditions, fit alternative probability models to the data, and show that the incubation period distribution changes with host age. By simulating spatially-explicit epidemiological models with different incubation-period distributions, we study the conditions for a significant time lag between epidemics of cryptic infection and the associated epidemics of symptomatic disease. We examine the sensitivity of this lag to differing distributional assumptions about the incubation period (i.e. exponential versus Gamma). We demonstrate that accurate information about the incubation period distribution of a pathosystem can be critical in assessing the true scale of pathogen invasion behind early disease symptoms in the field; likewise, it can be central to model-based prediction of epidemic risk and evaluation of disease management strategies. Our results highlight that reliance on observation of disease symptoms can cause significant delay in detection of soil-borne pathogen epidemics and mislead practitioners and epidemiologists about the timing, extent, and viability of disease control measures for limiting economic loss. © 2014 Leclerc et al.},

   abstract = {<p>The resources available for managing disease epidemics – whether in animals, plants or humans – are limited by a range of practical and financial constraints. Optimal control has been widely explored for optimising allocation of these resources to maximise their impact. The most common approach assumes a deterministic, continuous model to approximate the epidemic dynamics. However, real systems are stochastic and so a range of outcomes are possible for any given epidemic situation. The deterministic models are also known to be poor approximations in cases where the number of infected hosts is low – either globally or within a subset of the population – and these cases are highly relevant in the context of control. Hence, this work explores the effectiveness of disease management strategies derived using optimal control theory when applied to a more realistic, stochastic form of disease model. We demonstrate that the deterministic optimal control solutions are not optimal in cases where the disease is eradicated or close to eradication. The range of potential outcomes in the stochastic models means that optimising the deterministic case will not reliably eradicate disease – the required rate of control is higher than the deterministic optimal control would predict. Using Model Predictive Control, in which the optimisation is performed repeatedly as the system evolves to correct for deviations from the optimal control predictions, improves performance but the level of control calculated at each repeated optimisation is still insufficient. To demonstrate this, we present several simple heuristics to allocate control resources across different locations which can outperform the strategies calculated by MPC when the control budget is sufficient for eradication. Our illustration uses examples based on simulation of the spatial spread of plant disease but similar issues would be expected in any deterministic model where infection is driven close to zero.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Spatial heterogeneities and spatial separation of hosts are often seen as key factors when developing accurate predictive models of the spread of pathogens. The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Infectious diseases of plants present an ongoing and increasing threat to international biosecurity, with wide-ranging implications. An important challenge in plant disease management is achieving early detection of invading pathogens, which requires effective surveillance through the implementation of appropriate monitoring programmes. However, when monitoring relies on visual inspection as a means of detection, surveillance is often hindered by a long incubation period (delay from infection to symptom onset) during which plants may be infectious but not displaying visible symptoms. ‘Sentinel’ plants–alternative susceptible host species that display visible symptoms of infection more rapidly–could be introduced to at-risk populations and included in monitoring programmes to act as early warning beacons for infection. However, while sentinel hosts exhibit faster disease progression and so allow pathogens to be detected earlier, this often comes at a cost: faster disease progression typically promotes earlier onward transmission. Here, we construct a computational model of pathogen transmission to explore this trade-off and investigate how including sentinel plants in monitoring programmes could facilitate earlier detection of invasive plant pathogens. Using <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> infection in <italic>Olea europaea</italic> (European olive) as a current high profile case study, for which <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (Madagascan periwinkle) is a candidate sentinel host, we apply a Bayesian optimisation algorithm to determine the optimal number of sentinel hosts to introduce for a given sampling effort, as well as the optimal division of limited surveillance resources between crop and sentinel plants.

   abstract = {<p> Nonnative plant pests and pathogens threaten biodiversity, ecosystem function, food security, and economic livelihoods. As new invasive populations establish, often as an unintended consequence of international trade, they can become additional sources of introductions, accelerating global spread through bridgehead effects. While the study of non‐native pest spread has used computational models to provide insights into drivers and dynamics of biological invasions and inform management, efforts have focused on local or regional scales and are challenged by complex transmission networks arising from bridgehead population establishment. This paper presents a flexible spatiotemporal stochastic network model called PoPS (Pest or Pathogen Spread) Global that couples international trade networks with core drivers of biological invasions—climate suitability, host availability, and propagule pressure—quantified through open, globally available databases to forecast the spread of non‐native plant pests. The modular design of the framework makes it adaptable for various pests capable of dispersing via human‐mediated pathways, supports proactive responses to emerging pests when limited data are available, and enables forecasts at different spatial and temporal resolutions. We demonstrate the framework using a case study of the invasive planthopper spotted lanternfly ( <italic>Lycorma delicatula</italic> ). The model was calibrated with historical, known spotted lanternfly introductions to identify potential bridgehead populations that may contribute to global spread. This global view of phytosanitary pandemics provides crucial information for anticipating biological invasions, quantifying transport pathways risk levels, and allocating resources to safeguard plant health, agriculture, and natural resources. </p>},

Microsatellite and minisatellite typing are useful techniques for deciphering the population structure of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, the causal agent of Asiatic citrus canker. This paper presents a molecular epidemiology study, which has improved our understanding of the history of the pathogen's introductions into the Arabian Peninsula, since it was first reported in the 1980s. An unexpectedly high genetic diversity of the pathogen was revealed. The four distinct genetic lineages within X. citri pv. citri, which have been reported throughout the world, were identified in the Arabian Peninsula, most likely as the result of multiple introductions. No copper-resistant X. citri pv. citri strains were identified. The pathogen's population structure on Mexican lime (their shared host species) was closely examined in two countries, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. We highlighted the marked prevalence of specialist pathotype A* strains in both countries, which suggests that specialist strains of X. citri pv. citri may perform better than generalist strains when they occur concomitantly in this environment. Subclade 4.2 was the prevailing lineage identified. Several analyses (genetic structure deciphered by discriminant analysis of principal components, RST-based genetic differentiation, geographic structure) congruently suggested the role of human activities in the pathogen's spread. We discuss the implications of these results on the management of Asiatic citrus canker in the region.},

For example, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the elderly are often preferentially protected. For diseases of plants and animals, certain sub-populations can drive mitigation because they are intrinsically more valuable for ecological, economic, socio-cultural or political reasons. Here, we use optimal control theory to identify strategies to optimally protect a ‘high-value’ sub-population when there is a limited budget and epidemiological uncertainty. We use protection of the Redwood National Park in California in the face of the large ongoing state-wide epidemic of sudden oak death (caused by <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> ) as a case study. We concentrate on whether control should be focused entirely within the National Park itself, or whether treatment of the growing epidemic in the surrounding ‘buffer region’ can instead be more profitable. We find that, depending on rates of infection and the size of the ongoing epidemic, focusing control on the high-value region is often optimal. However, priority should sometimes switch from the buffer region to the high-value region only as the local outbreak grows. We characterize how the timing of any switch depends on epidemiological and logistic parameters, and test robustness to systematic misspecification of these factors due to imperfect prior knowledge. </p>},

Understanding the factors that determine disease dynamics in pathosystems that share similarities can help to design control strategies focused on minimizing transmission chains. Here, we introduce a compartmental model for X. fastidiosa-caused diseases in Europe that accounts for the main relevant epidemiological processes, including the seasonal dynamics of P. spumarius. The model was confronted with epidemiological data from the two major outbreaks of X. fastidiosa in Europe, the olive quick disease syndrome in Apulia, Italy, caused by the subspecies pauca, and the almond leaf scorch disease in Mallorca, Spain, caused by subspecies multiplex and fastidiosa. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we show how the model successfully reproduces the general field data in both diseases. In a global sensitivity analysis, the vector-to-plant and plant-to-vector transmission rates, together with the vector removal rate, were the most influential parameters in determining the time of the infectious host population peak, the incidence peak, and the final number of dead hosts. We also used our model to check different vector-based control strategies, showing that a joint strategy focused on increasing the rate of vector removal while lowering the number of annual newborn vectors is optimal for disease control.
