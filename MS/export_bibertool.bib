  ABSTRACT = {<p>A number of high profile eradication attempts on plant pathogens have recently been attempted in response to the increasing number of introductions of economically significant nonnative pathogen species. Eradication programs involve the removal of a large proportion of a host population and can thus lead to significant social and economic costs. In this paper we use a spatially explicit stochastic model to simulate an invading pathogen and show that it is possible to identify an optimal control radius, i.e., one that minimizes the total number of hosts removed during an eradication campaign that is effective in eradicating the pathogen. However, by simulating the epidemic and eradication processes in multiple landscapes, we demonstrate that the optimal radius depends critically on landscape pattern (i.e., the spatial configuration of hosts within the landscape). In particular, we find that the optimal radius, and also the number of host removals associated with it, increases with both the level of aggregation and the density of hosts in the landscape. The result is of practical significance and demonstrates that the location of an invading epidemic should be a key consideration in the design of future eradication strategies.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>The eradication of nonnative plant pathogens is a key challenge in plant disease epidemiology. Asiatic citrus canker is an economically significant disease of citrus caused by the bacterial plant pathogen Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. The pathogen is a major exotic disease problem in many citrus producing areas of the world including the United States, Brazil, and Australia. Various eradication attempts have been made on the disease but have been associated with significant social and economic costs due to the necessary removal of large numbers of host trees. In this paper, a spatially explicit stochastic simulation model of Asiatic citrus canker is introduced that describes an epidemic of the disease in a heterogeneous host landscape. We show that an optimum eradication strategy can be determined that minimizes the adverse costs associated with eradication. In particular, we show how the optimum strategy and its total cost depend on the topological arrangement of the host landscape. We discuss the implications of the results for invading plant disease epidemics in general and for historical and future eradication attempts on Asiatic citrus canker.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {The introduction of the Xylella fastidiosa Wells bacterium into Apulia (South Italy) has caused the massive dieback of olive trees, and is threatening olive production throughout the Mediterranean Region. The key vector of X. fastidiosa in Europe is the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius L. The dispersal capabilities of P. spumarius are poorly known, despite being a key parameter for the prediction of the spread of the bacterium. In this study, we have examined the dispersal of P. spumarius adults in two different agroecosystems in Italy: an olive grove in Apulia (Southern Italy) and a meadow in Piedmont (Northern Italy). Insects were marked with albumin and released during seven independent trials over 2 yr. The recapture data were pooled separately for each agroecosystem and used to estimate the dispersal kernels of P. spumarius in the olive grove and in the meadow. The diffusion coefficient estimate for P. spumarius was higher in the meadow than in the olive grove. The median distance from the release point for 1 d of dispersal was 26 m in the olive grove and 35 m in the meadow. On the basis of our model, we estimated that 50% of the spittlebug population remained within 200 m (98% within 400 m) during the 2 mo period of high abundance of the vector on olives in Apulia. The dispersal of P. spumarius is thus limited to some hundreds of meters throughout the whole year, although it can be influenced to a great extent by the structure of the agroecosystem.},

  ABSTRACT = {Xylella fastidiosa is the causal agent of plant diseases that cause massive economic damage. In 2013, a strain of the bacterium was, for the first time, detected in the European territory (Italy), causing the Olive Quick Decline Syndrome. We simulate future spread of the disease based on climatic-suitability modeling and radial expansion of the invaded territory. An economic model is developed to compute impact based on discounted foregone profits and losses in investment. The model projects impact for Italy, Greece, and Spain, as these countries account for around 95\% of the European olive oil production. Climatic suitability modeling indicates that, depending on the suitability threshold, 95.5 to 98.9\%, 99.2 to 99.8\%, and 84.6 to 99.1\% of the national areas of production fall into suitable territory in Italy, Greece, and Spain, respectively. For Italy, across the considered rates of radial range expansion the potential economic impact over 50 y ranges from 1.9 billion to 5.2 billion Euros for the economic worst-case scenario, in which production ceases after orchards die off. If replanting with resistant varieties is feasible, the impact ranges from 0.6 billion to 1.6 billion Euros. Depending on whether replanting is feasible, between 0.5 billion and 1.3 billion Euros can be saved over the course of 50 y if disease spread is reduced from 5.18 to 1.1 km per year. The analysis stresses the necessity to strengthen the ongoing research on cultivar resistance traits and application of phytosanitary measures, including vector control and inoculum suppression, by removing host plants. </p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p> Bacterial tree diseases have been mainly studied in agriculture and horticulture. For forest trees, damage due to bacterial diseases is understudied. Moreover, bacterial tree diseases often appear in the context of so‐called complex diseases, which are dependent on other factors, such as multiple microorganisms, insects or abiotic factors which weaken the host. In recent years, outbreaks of bacterial tree diseases, such as <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> in the Mediterranean region or acute oak decline (AOD) in the United Kingdom, raised the awareness of bacterial diseases on forest trees. In this review, we aim to summarise the current issues and available knowledge about bacterial diseases of forest trees in Central Europe. Furthermore, we identify potential bacterial pathogens that could gain importance in the future for central European forests. The methods used were a systematic literature search and the analysis of the data collected over the last 10 years on bacterial diseases by the Swiss forest protection service. We conclude that, on one side, complex bacterial diseases could increase in importance, especially considering ongoing climate change. Therefore, the bacterial community of diseased trees (the pathobiome) needs to be studied more in depth to understand the emergence of complex bacterial diseases. On the other side, host ranges of highly pathogenic invasive genera and species, such as <italic>Xylella,</italic> need to be investigated experimentally for common central European tree species and varieties, to implement proactive risk management strategies against bacterial diseases in forest trees. Finally, urban trees and green spaces should be monitored more closely, as they could serve as starting points for bacterial disease outbreaks in forests, similarly to other emerging diseases and pathogens. </p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p> Five areas in urban Miami were identified to study the spread of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri to determine if the practice of removing exposed citrus trees within 38.1 m of trees affected by citrus canker was adequate to curtail further bacterial spread. To accomplish this, 18,769 trees in dooryards were surveyed, geo-referenced by differential global positioning systems (GPS), and assayed for disease severity, age of infection, citrus cultivar, location of infection in tree, and canopy size. For each tree, the date the tree became infected was estimated and used to separate trees into contiguous 30-day categories. For each area studied, distance measurements between focal trees and newly infected trees were calculated for various temporal periods of 30, 60, 90, and 120 days in duration, corresponding to intervals of inspection survey. A visual basic application was used to calculate the distances between each newly diseased tree and all prior focal trees. The nearest distance was used because it was considered the most conservative estimate possible. It is therefore likely to be an underestimate of spread but is a good estimate of the minimum possible distances of spread. For the first four 30-day periods among the five study areas, calculated maximum distances of spread ranged from 12 to 3,474 m, indicating a broad continuum of distance for bacterial spread was possible. Disease increased during the first two-thirds of the time studied and reached an asymptote due to dry conditions in the final one-third of the duration of the study. Cross correlation analysis indicated that disease was best visualized 107 days following rainstorms with wind. Analysis of regional spatial point patterns was performed temporally for each 30-day period via a modified Ripley's K-function. Spatiotemporal analyses between periods over areas larger than previously examined were accomplished via spatiotemporal semivariogram analysis. These methods in combination demonstrated rapid increases in range of spatial dependency and range of spatiotemporal dependency for all study sites. This corresponded to rapid spread of disease across the regions studied in response to rainstorms with wind followed by a “filling in” of disease on remaining noninfected susceptible trees through time by less intense rain events. A stochastic quadratization technique demonstrated that disease incidence and disease severity were not greatly affected by urban host density but were positively correlated to host susceptibility within local 0.25-km <sup>2</sup> quadrats. </p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Spatial species distribution models often assume isotropy and stationarity, implying that spatial dependence is direction-invariant and uniform throughout the study area. However, these assumptions are violated when dispersal barriers are present. Despite this, the issue of nonstationarity has been little explored in the context of plant health. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of barriers in the distribution of Xylella fastidiosa in the demarcated area in Alicante, Spain. Occurrence data from 2018 were analyzed through spatial Bayesian hierarchical models. The stationary model, illustrating a scenario without control interventions or geographical features, was compared with three nonstationary models: a model with mountains as physical barriers, and two models with a continuous and discontinuous perimeter barrier representing hypothetical control interventions. In the stationary model, the posterior mean of the spatial range, as the distance where two observations are uncorrelated, was 4,030 m 95% credible interval (2,907 to 5,564). This distance can be used to define the buffer zone in the demarcated area. The predicted probability of X. fastidiosa presence in the area outside the barrier was 0.46 with the stationary model, whereas it was reduced to 0.29 and 0.36 with the continuous and discontinuous barrier models, respectively. Differences between the discontinuous and continuous barrier models showed that breaks, where no control interventions were implemented, resulted in a higher predicted probability of X. fastidiosa presence in the areas with low sampling intensity. These results may help authorities prioritize the areas for surveillance and disease control.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {Olives are a crucial economic crop in Mediterranean countries. Detailed spatial information on the distribution and condition of crops at regional and national scales is essential to ensure the continuity of crop quality and yield efficiency. However, most earlier studies on olive tree mapping focused mainly on small parcels using single-sensor, very high resolution (VHR) data, which is time-consuming, expensive and cannot feasibly be scaled up to a larger area. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data fusion for the regional mapping of olive trees for the first time, using the Izmir Province of Türkiye, an ancient olive-growing region, as a case study. Three different monthly composite images reflecting the different phenological stages of olive trees were selected to separate olive trees from other land cover types. Seven land-cover classes, including olives, were mapped separately using a random forest classifier for each year between 2017 and 2021. The results were assessed using the k-fold cross-validation method, and the final olive tree map of Izmir was produced by combining the olive tree distribution over two consecutive years. District-level areas covered by olive trees were calculated and validated using official statistics from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). The K-fold cross-validation accuracy varied from 94% to 95% between 2017 and 2021, and the final olive map achieved 98% overall accuracy with 93% producer accuracy for the olive class. The district-level olive area was strongly related to the TUIK statistics (R2 = 0.60, NRMSE = 0.64). This study used Sentinel data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to produce a regional-scale olive distribution map that can be scaled up to the entire country and replicated elsewhere. This map can, therefore, be used as a foundation for other scientific studies on olive trees, particularly for the development of effective management practices.},

Taking into account that this is the first confirmed record of the presence of Xf in the European Union (EU) territory and fairing its possible spread from the affected site, the EU has issued the Commission Implementing Decision L 45/29-31 (February 24, 2014), which prohibits the transfer from the province of Lecce of all plant genera and species not listed in the Annex I of the cited Decision. A survey was therefore initiated to verify the health status of a number of ornamental and forestry plants growing mostly in nurseries, but also in public and private gardens, which are or can be naturally exposed to high inoculum pressure. Samples collected from 207 conifers, 105 members of the family Arecaceae, Musaceae and Cycadaceae, and 208 succulent plants (totalling 520) were comparatively examined by serological (DAS-ELISA) and molecular (PCR) methods. None of the tested plant species proved to be infected, providing a strong indication that they may not be susceptible to field infection by the Xf subsp. pauca strain currently present in the province of Lecce.},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Strains of the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa subspecies multiplex (Xfm) and pauca (Xfp) isolated from symptomatic almond and olive plants in Spain and Italy were used in this study. Because of the risk of host jump and considering the importance of southern highbush blueberry production in Spain, we tested a small set of these strains for their potential to infect and cause disease symptoms in blueberries under greenhouse experiments. Xfm IVIA5901 (isolated from almonds in Alicante, Spain) caused symptoms similar to those caused by Xfm AlmaEm3 (isolated from blueberries in Georgia, U.S.A., and used as a reference strain capable of inducing severe symptoms in blueberry). Nevertheless, bacterial populations of Xfm IVIA5901 in planta were significantly lower than those of Xfm AlmaEm3. Xfm ESVL (isolated from almonds, Alicante, Spain) and Xfp XYL1961/18 (isolated from olives, Ibiza Island, Spain) caused limited symptoms, while Xfm XYL466/19 (isolated from wild olives, Mallorca Island, Spain) and Xfm XF3348 (isolated from almonds, Mallorca Island, Spain) and Xfp De Donno (isolated from olives, Puglia, Italy, and representative of the devastating olive quick decline syndrome) did not cause symptoms nor colonize blueberries. This study suggests that certain strains already found in Europe could infect blueberry if conditions conducive for a host jump in this region are met, such as proximity of blueberries to other infected hosts and presence of insect vectors that feed on these crops. Surveys on the presence of X. fastidiosa in blueberries in Spain and other European countries are needed to anticipate possible issues.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Current management strategies for European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests are oriented towards the use of natural regeneration processes. They aim to maintain continuity of stand structure by preserving seed-producing and shelter trees at varying densities. Soil scarification techniques may be employed to support the natural regeneration of pine. Our study is based on data from seven study sites in the German lowlands, where the basal areas of the overstorey pine trees varied between 4 and 21 m2/ha. The soil scarification methods ranged from full surface ploughing by tractor or horse through small-scale scarification by cultivators to sites without soil scarification. Differences in the densities, spatial distributions, age structures, and above-ground development of pine seedlings were evaluated. We analysed the spatial interactions between overstorey pine trees and the densities of naturally regenerated pine seedlings as a function of the microsite types using the multitype Strauss hard-core process (MSH) method. The results show a significant decrease in height growth with increasing stand density after a period of 5 years, with seedling density and spatial patterns strongly influenced by soil scarification. The MSH pairwise interaction analyses revealed significant negative effects on seedling densities based on combinations of microsites and overstorey trees.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {Systemic bacteria such as Xylella fastidiosa can be vertically transmitted by using diseased propagative material during nursery tree production. We tested the hypothesis that X. fastidiosa is not transmitted by symptomless olive tree sprouts. In addition, we investigated the distribution of bacteria in olive plants (different parts of canopy and root system) with initial leaf scorch symptoms and with symptoms spread throughout the canopy. In both studies, the presence of bacteria was tested by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). For the first hypothesis, sprouts from a symptomless olive tree were rooted and checked for X. fastidiosa infection 32 months later. A total of 57.7\% (41 of 71) of rooted seedlings were positive for X. fastidiosa (Ct from 24.25 to 31.82) but only one plant had scorched leaves. Regarding the distribution of the bacteria in the diseased plants, results based on qPCR showed that X. fastidiosa was systemically distributed through the olive plant canopy (30\% to 77\% of sampled tissues, with Ct values from 19.56 to 31.59). Samples from trees showing symptoms of olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS), taken 3 m above the lateral branch with symptoms, were positive for the presence of X. fastidiosa, as was the root system. The results demonstrate that vegetative material from olive plants used for rooting must be carefully selected for the absence of X. fastidiosa. Also, based on the qPCR-positive results, pruning may have a limited effect on eliminating the bacteria from diseased plants, even from the ones showing few OQDS symptoms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Increasing rates of global trade and travel, as well as changing climatic patterns, have led to more frequent outbreaks of plant disease epidemics worldwide. Mathematical modellingModelling is a key tool in predicting where and how these new threats will spread, as well as in assessing how damaging they might be. Models can also be used to inform disease management, providing a rational methodology for comparing the performance of possible control strategies against one another. For emerging epidemics, in which new pathogens or pathogen strains are actively spreading into new regions, the spatial component of spread becomes particularly important, both to make predictions and to optimise disease control. In this chapter we illustrate how the spatial spread of emerging plant diseases can be modelled at the landscape scale via spatially explicit compartmental modelsModellingspatially explicit compartmental models. Our particular focus is on the crucial role of the dispersal kernel – which parameterises the probability of pathogen spread from an infected host to susceptible hosts at any given distance – in determining outcomes of epidemics. We add disease management to our model by testing performance of a simple ``one off'' form of reactive disease control, in which sites within a particular distance of locations detected to contain infection are removed in a single round of disease management. We use this simplified model to show how ostensibly arcane decisions made by the modeller – most notably whether or not the underpinning disease model allows for stochasticity (i.e. randomness) – can greatly impact on disease management recommendations. Our chapter is accompanied (see Supplementary Material) by example code in the programming language R available via an online repository, allowing readers to run the models we present for themselves.},

  ABSTRACT = {Does Xylella fastidiosa, a bacterial plant pathogen with noncirculative foregut-borne transmission, manipulate behavior of its sharpshooter vector to facilitate its own inoculation? To answer this question, blue-green sharpshooters, Graphocephala atropunctata (Signoret), were reared on basil to clean their foreguts, then removed from the colony and given one of four pre-electropenetrography (EPG) treatments: i) old colony adults on basil, ii) young colony adults on basil, iii) young colony adults held on healthy grapevine for 4 days, and iv) young colony adults held on Xf-infected (symptomatic) grapevine for 4 days. After treatments, stylet probing behaviors were recorded on healthy grapevine via AC-DC electropenetrography. Waveforms representing putative Xf inoculation (XB1 [salivation and rinsing egestion] and XC1 [discharging egestion]) and other behaviors were statistically compared among treatments. Mean number of events per insect and 'total' duration per insect of XB1 and XC1 were highest for insects from healthy grape, lowest for basil (regardless of insect age), and intermediate for Xf-infected grape. The surprising results showed that prior exposure to healthy grapevines had a stronger effect on subsequent performance of inoculation behaviors on healthy grapevine than did prior exposure to Xf-infected grapevine. It is hypothesized that non-Xf microbes were acquired from healthy grapevine, causing greater clogging of the precibarium, leading to more performance of inoculation behaviors. This study shows for the first time that presence of noncirculative, foregut-borne microbes can directly manipulate a vector's behavior to increase inoculation. Also, EPG can uniquely visualize the dynamic interactions between vectors and the microbes they carry.},

  ABSTRACT = {Outbreaks of a plant disease in a landscape can be meaningfully modelled using networks with nodes representing individual crop-fields, and edges representing potential infection pathways between them. Their spatial structure, which resembles that of a regular lattice, makes such networks fairly robust against epidemics. Yet, it is well-known how the addition of a few shortcuts can turn robust regular lattices into vulnerable ‘small world’ networks. Although the relevance of this phenomenon has been shown theoretically for networks with nodes corresponding to individual host plants, its real-world implications at a larger scale (i.e. in networks with nodes representing crop fields or other plantations) remain elusive. Focusing on realistic spatial networks connecting olive orchards in Andalusia (Southern Spain), the world's leading olive producer, we show how even very small probabilities of long distance dispersal of infectious vectors result in a small-world effect that dramatically exacerbates a hypothetical outbreak of a disease targeting olive trees (loosely modelled on known epidemiological information on the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, an important emerging threat for European agriculture). More specifically, we found that the probability of long distance vector dispersal has a disproportionately larger effect on epidemic dynamics compared to pathogen's intrinsic infectivity, increasing total infected area by up to one order of magnitude (in the absence of quarantine). Furthermore, even a very small probability of long distance dispersal increased the effort needed to halt a hypothetical outbreak through quarantine by about 50\% in respect to scenarios modelling local/short distance pathogen's dispersal only. This highlights how identifying (and disrupting) long distance dispersal processes may be more efficacious to contain a plant disease epidemic than surveillance and intervention concentrated on local scale transmission processes.},

  ABSTRACT = {The spatial structure of a host population has a profound effect on the dynamics of infectious diseases. The basic reproduction number, a central quantity in the study of epidemic dynamics, is affected by host clustering as well as host density. Several authors have developed methods to quantify the basic reproduction number in a spatially structured host population. The methods used and the expressions derived are however difficult to apply to real life spatial host structures. In this paper we introduce an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number using the O-ring statistic, developed in spatial statistics, that quantifies the host density as a function of the distance from a randomly selected host individual. The O-ring statistic is frequently used in the study of the ecology of spatially structured plant populations, being a convenient summary of the properties of a landscape by way of a single function. The connection we develop between spatial statistics and epidemic dynamics can be used to study the effect of host spatial pattern on the basic reproduction number of infectious diseases. As well as showing how explicit expressions for the basic reproduction number can be derived for landscapes with standard structures, our expression for the basic reproduction number is tested against a simulation model. The model structure in our simulation is motivated by the spread of a plant disease epidemic, although it is applicable more broadly. The agreement between our analytic expression for the basic reproduction number and the corresponding numeric quantity extracted from simulations is close to perfect across a wide range of landscape structures and model parameterisations, and including cases in which more than one species of host is at risk of infection.},

  ABSTRACT = {Knowledge of the incubation period of infectious diseases (time between host infection and expression of disease symptoms) is crucial to our epidemiological understanding and the design of appropriate prevention and control policies. Plant diseases cause substantial damage to agricultural and arboricultural systems, but there is still very little information about how the incubation period varies within host populations. In this paper, we focus on the incubation period of soilborne plant pathogens, which are difficult to detect as they spread and infect the hosts underground and above-ground symptoms occur considerably later. We conducted experiments on Rhizoctonia solani in sugar beet, as an example pathosystem, and used modelling approaches to estimate the incubation period distribution and demonstrate the impact of differing estimations on our epidemiological understanding of plant diseases. We present measurements of the incubation period obtained in field conditions, fit alternative probability models to the data, and show that the incubation period distribution changes with host age. By simulating spatially-explicit epidemiological models with different incubation-period distributions, we study the conditions for a significant time lag between epidemics of cryptic infection and the associated epidemics of symptomatic disease. We examine the sensitivity of this lag to differing distributional assumptions about the incubation period (i.e. exponential versus Gamma). We demonstrate that accurate information about the incubation period distribution of a pathosystem can be critical in assessing the true scale of pathogen invasion behind early disease symptoms in the field; likewise, it can be central to model-based prediction of epidemic risk and evaluation of disease management strategies. Our results highlight that reliance on observation of disease symptoms can cause significant delay in detection of soil-borne pathogen epidemics and mislead practitioners and epidemiologists about the timing, extent, and viability of disease control measures for limiting economic loss. © 2014 Leclerc et al.},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>The resources available for managing disease epidemics – whether in animals, plants or humans – are limited by a range of practical and financial constraints. Optimal control has been widely explored for optimising allocation of these resources to maximise their impact. The most common approach assumes a deterministic, continuous model to approximate the epidemic dynamics. However, real systems are stochastic and so a range of outcomes are possible for any given epidemic situation. The deterministic models are also known to be poor approximations in cases where the number of infected hosts is low – either globally or within a subset of the population – and these cases are highly relevant in the context of control. Hence, this work explores the effectiveness of disease management strategies derived using optimal control theory when applied to a more realistic, stochastic form of disease model. We demonstrate that the deterministic optimal control solutions are not optimal in cases where the disease is eradicated or close to eradication. The range of potential outcomes in the stochastic models means that optimising the deterministic case will not reliably eradicate disease – the required rate of control is higher than the deterministic optimal control would predict. Using Model Predictive Control, in which the optimisation is performed repeatedly as the system evolves to correct for deviations from the optimal control predictions, improves performance but the level of control calculated at each repeated optimisation is still insufficient. To demonstrate this, we present several simple heuristics to allocate control resources across different locations which can outperform the strategies calculated by MPC when the control budget is sufficient for eradication. Our illustration uses examples based on simulation of the spatial spread of plant disease but similar issues would be expected in any deterministic model where infection is driven close to zero.</p>},

We use the framework to analyse and predict the spread of Huanglongbing disease or citrus greening in the U.S. We estimate epidemiological parameters using survey data from one region (Texas) and show how to transfer and test parameters to construct predictive spatio-temporal models for another region (California). The models are used to screen effective coordinated and reactive management strategies for different regions.</p>},

  ABSTRACT = {<p>Spatial heterogeneities and spatial separation of hosts are often seen as key factors when developing accurate predictive models of the spread of pathogens. The question we address in this paper is how coarse the resolution of the spatial data can be for a model to be a useful tool for informing control policies. We examine this problem using the specific case of foot-and-mouth disease spreading between farms using the formulation developed during the 2001 epidemic in the United Kingdom. We show that, if our model is carefully parameterized to match epidemic behavior, then using aggregate county-scale data from the United States is sufficient to closely determine optimal control measures (specifically ring culling). This result also holds when the approach is extended to theoretical distributions of farms where the spatial clustering can be manipulated to extremes. We have therefore shown that, although spatial structure can be critically important in allowing us to predict the emergent population-scale behavior from a knowledge of the individual-level dynamics, for this specific applied question, such structure is mostly subsumed in the parameterization allowing us to make policy predictions in the absence of high-quality spatial information. We believe that this approach will be of considerable benefit across a range of disciplines where data are only available at intermediate spatial scales.</p>},
